# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
### With the use of postgres and pgAdmin we are asked to creat SQL queries to create the tables to find how many employees were retiring, the titles that were retiring, and creating a list of possible employees for a mentorship program.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
## How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
### With the "silver tsunami" there will be 90,398 vacancies.
## Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
### I would say no with the criteria of 1965 with 1,549 employees thats a huge gab.
